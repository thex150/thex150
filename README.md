### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy who loves programming, cybersecurity and privacy

Just my opinion:
My view of programming is that it's useful to have a general understanding of languages and how they work, but that doesn't mean you use them everyday.
For example:
I learned C++ +- 3/4 years ago and was doing some little programs but I don't use it anymore because I discovered Rust which is 100x better (it's the future)

I've learned these languages, but like C, for the most part I don't use them anymore.
html, css, lua, python, javascript, java, php, c++, rust, assembly(x86_64)

the languages I still use for 

web development
html, css, javascript (frontend)
Rust (actix & rocket for the backend

gaming 
lua (I recently made a FiveM anticheat for my server)

desktop app (native ui & web assembly)
Rust (Slint & Egui)
Assembly

mobile
Rust (I have seen that we can now use rust I will learn this soon)

I still use 
python and php when I need to use them in ctf or to modify an exploit but don't use them to make a project 

I have some project I am working on with my friends like a 
- web fuzzer
- network scanner 
- password manager
- some osint tools
- passive subdomain finder via sources like censys, etc ...
- others...

All these projects will be developed mainly in rust, with a website for the projects that need it, and will be accessible only to the people to whom we give access.
If you are interested to work with me and my friends these project, dm me on my social network (session prefered)

I am also learning 3d with blender, c4d, graphic design and video editing
